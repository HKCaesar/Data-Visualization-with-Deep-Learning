# Data-Visualization-with-Deep-Learning

The aim of this project is to explore the possibilities the deep learning can offer to the data visualization domain.

## Using and understanding tensorFlow 

First of all , we choose tensorFlow API to build and train neuronal networks because :

  - This allows us to code in python a language we are familiar to.

  - TensorFlow is quite fast and can be used with a GPU which help to conclued trainning sessions faster because we use a lot       of matricial calculation.

  - Tensor flow has a great and active community and a lot of documentation which help develop faster.

### firstStepMNIST.py

firstStepMnist.py is a script provided by tensorflow as a demo  and learning support.
> This script comes with an explanation available here https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/mnist/beginners/
 
 To sum up, this script is a basic machine learning program "hello world" like. But , however it allows to understand how 
it works.

This script have a few key components. First of all the dataset , it downloads the data set and divides it to use it efficiently. A neuronal network must never learn from validation and test data.
