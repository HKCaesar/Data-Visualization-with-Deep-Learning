# Data-Visualization-with-Deep-Learning

The aim of this project is to explore the possibilities the deep learning can offer to the data visualization domain.

## Using and understanding tensorFlow 

First of all , we choose tensorFlow API to build and train neuronal networks because :

  - This allow us to code in python a language we are familiar to.

  - TensorFlow is quite fast and can be used with a GPU which help to conclued trainning sessions faster because we use a lot       of matricial calculation.

  - Tensor flow has a great and active community and a lot of documentation which help develop faster.
